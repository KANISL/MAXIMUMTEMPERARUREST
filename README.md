This project creates an interactive web application using Gradio and Plotly that visualizes historical maximum temperature records from around the world on a comprehensive world map. The application features a color-coded choropleth map where countries are shaded from blue (cooler) to red (hotter) based on their highest recorded temperatures, with interactive hover tooltips displaying detailed information including the exact temperature, location, and year of each record. Users can switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit units, explore top hottest countries through dynamic bar charts, search for specific country information, and view global temperature statistics, making it an educational and engaging tool for understanding extreme weather patterns and climate data across different nations with notable records like Libya's disputed 58°C, Death Valley's 54.4°C, and Australia's 50.7°C.
